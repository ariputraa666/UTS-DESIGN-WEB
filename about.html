            <P>Horizontal, vertical and dynamic lines can help shape a room and "guide" our view. Creating lines using furniture and objects as well as structural design in a room can establish harmony, continuity and contrast Besides that, there are also dynamic lines that refer to diagonal, zigzag, or curved lines. These lines can be seen in several elements in the room, such as the stairs, which give energy and movement to the structure of the room.</P>
